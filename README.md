# Brief
Develop a native mobile app which uses the Flickr API to display a list of photos.
The look and feel of the app is up to you, but it should adhere to normal expectations for a user of that platform. 
The app should display a list of photos, along with the poster's userid and user icon. 
The app should display alongside the photo a list of any tags associated with the photo. 
Tapping on the photo should take the user to a separate page wherein they can see more detail about the photo (e.g. Title, date take,Â  any content description, etc.), 
Tapping on a user id/photo should produce a list of photos by that user. 
There should be a default search of "Yorkshire" on first load and safe_search should be set to safe. 

# Additional Features
The app should be able to search for Photos by tag or lists of tags, and provide whether a photo should contain all or some tags
The app could allow for searching for a user's photos by their username
Any other additional features you might be able to think of using the data available (be creative)
The app should not require the use of authenticated API call.

# Publishing
For this, push your app to your Git Repo of choice and return the URL to us so we can view it. 
Use the README.md file to explain any decisions made. The app should have appropriate tests. 
You're free to use whatever architecture you like, but explain why you made that decision. 
If you use any 3rd Party SDKs please explain in the README.md why you used them and what for.
